    "# File Handling in python\n",
    "\n",
    "File handling in Python allows you to work with files on your system, such as reading, writing, and manipulating file content. Python provides built-in functions for handling files. Below is an explanation of how to handle files in Python with examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "**File Handling Operations**\n",
    "1. Opening a File:\n",
    "    - Use the open() function to open a file in different modes.\n",
    "    - Syntax: open(file_name, mode)\n",
    "1. Reading from a File:\n",
    "    - You can read the contents of a file using read(), readline(), or readlines().\n",
    "    - read(): Reads the entire content.\n",
    "    - readline(): Reads a single line.\n",
    "    - readlines(): Reads all lines and returns them as a list.    \n",
    "1. Writing to a File:\n",
    "    - You can write to a file using write() or writelines().\n",
    "    - write(): Writes a string to the file.\n",
    "    - writelines(): Writes a list of strings to the file.\n",
    "1. Closing a File:\n",
    "    - It's good practice to close the file after performing operations to free up resources using close().\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Modes for Opening Files:\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "    'r': Read (default mode, file must exist).\n",
    "    'w': Write (creates a new file or truncates an existing file).\n",
    "    'a': Append (writes data to the end of the file).\n",
    "    'b': Binary mode (used for non-text files).\n",
    "    'x': Exclusive creation (creates a new file but fails if the file exists).\n",
    "    't': Text mode (default mode for reading and writing text files).\n",
    "</pre>"
